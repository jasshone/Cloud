      <p>This site is under construction and will be updated periodically.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, here's my description from my other site + blog: </p>
      <p>"Hi! Iâ€™m Jasmine Shone, a current student at MIT. This summer, I am a research intern at the Learning and Intelligent Systems lab at MIT under Professor Kaelbling and Professor Lozano-Perez, working on robots that are better able to transfer knowledge from training data to real-world environments. I have experience building projects in Computer Vision, NLP, medical ML, deep learning, and robotics, as well as experience with data science and full stack development. In my free time, I enjoy singing/composing music, as well as writing short stories/making videogames."</p>
