          <h1>Cloud Resume Challenge</h1>
          <h2>I've been working on the cloud resume challenge for the past couple weeks, here's what I learned.</h2>
          <h3>My background</h3>
          <p>
            I completed a web dev course back in this January, so I had some prior experience with web dev which helped a lot.
            My primary knowledge is in the <strong>MERN stack</strong>, most of which I continued using during this challenge, except for using <strong>typescript</strong> instead of <strong>javascript</strong>.
            I haven't completed the entire challenge yet but I believe I will also use a different database instead of <strong>Mongo DB</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <p>
            Step 1 of the course was to get a website set up and running on AWS. A couple things I learned: 1. AWS account setup + authentication, 2. How to manage organizations and setup different accounts with different permissions on AWS, 3. How to start running a S3 static site on AWS, 4. How to add HTTPS protection to the site, 5. How to link the website to a domain name using Route 53.
            <br/>
            One big challenge was that AWS kept throwing an error when I was trying to register my domain name :( This is not yet resolved, unfortunately.
            It was also fun to refresh my knowledge of web dev + learn a bit of typescript, which is more similar to javascript than I thought.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <p>
            I kinda started going out of order starting here, so the steps are more representative of how long I thought
